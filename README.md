🚀 GoodsKart – E-Commerce Web App with Cart & Theme Toggle

I developed GoodsKart, a responsive mini e-commerce web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Key features include:

🛒 Add to Cart functionality with persistent storage using localStorage

🔍 Real-time product search

🌗 Light/Dark theme toggle with saved preferences

📱 Responsive design for mobile and desktop

💳 Dynamic cart total calculation and product removal

This project helped me strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, local storage handling, responsive UI design, and theme management while creating a smooth user experience.

💡 Excited to keep improving it with quantity tracking, checkout process, and backend integration in the future.
